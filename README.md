# Silent Signal

Research-grade Vietnamese isolated sign-language recognition, beginning with a
reproducible VSL400 data foundation. The first implemented milestone prepares,
validates, and splits the controlled-access videos; it deliberately does **not**
run whole-body pose extraction yet.

## Implemented milestone: VSL400 preparation

- Parse the three synchronized camera metadata files into one stable manifest.
- Support the release names front_view, left_view, right_view and the older
  public-code aliases cam_1, cam_2, cam_3.
- Preserve a three-video instance using one instance_id and canonical
  front/left/right view values.
- Validate schema, file existence, non-empty files, synchronized-view integrity,
  signer/gloss consistency, and published dataset counts.
- Optionally inspect video streams with ffprobe or fully decode with ffmpeg.
- Create a deterministic 80/10/10 signer-disjoint split. With 28 signers the
  target allocation is 22/3/3; candidate search balances instance counts and
  gloss coverage. An official split JSON takes precedence when supplied.
- Write CSV and Parquet manifests, a stable label map, split definition, and
  machine-readable validation reports.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11–3.13 (Python 3.12 is pinned for development).
- uv for the reproducible environment.
- FFmpeg on PATH only for --level probe or --level decode.
- Legitimate access to the controlled VSL400 video release.

## Setup

    uv sync --extra dev
    Copy-Item .env.example .env
    $env:VSL400_ROOT = "D:/datasets/VSL400"

Expected current release layout:

    VSL400/
    ├── front_view/
    ├── left_view/
    ├── right_view/
    ├── front_view.json
    ├── left_view.json
    ├── right_view.json
    └── gloss.csv

The legacy cam_1..3 directory/JSON names are discovered automatically.

## Run

Fast structural and file validation:

    uv run ss-prepare all --config configs/dataset/vsl400.yaml --level metadata

Inspect every video header:

    uv run ss-prepare all --config configs/dataset/vsl400.yaml --level probe --workers 8

Full decode is intentionally separate because it is expensive:

    uv run ss-prepare validate --config configs/dataset/vsl400.yaml --level decode --workers 4

Use an explicit root without setting an environment variable:

    uv run ss-prepare all --root D:/datasets/VSL400 --level metadata

Run uv run ss-prepare --help for individual build-manifest, validate,
create-splits, and summarize commands.

## Outputs

    data/
    ├── manifests/vsl400.csv
    ├── manifests/vsl400.parquet
    ├── labels/vsl400_labels.json
    └── splits/vsl400_signer_split.json

    artifacts/runs/data-preparation/
    ├── validation_report.json
    └── invalid_records.csv

data/raw, data/processed, and generated artifacts are ignored by Git. The
source release must never be committed.

## Quality checks

    uv run ruff check .
    uv run ruff format --check .
    uv run pytest

The data contract is documented in docs/data_contract.md.

## Google Colab

Use
[notebooks/00_vsl400_colab_preparation.ipynb](notebooks/00_vsl400_colab_preparation.ipynb)
to run preparation from Google Drive or a Git repository. The notebook persists
manifests, reports, label maps, signer splits, and resumable ffprobe results to
Drive. It expects an authorized, already extracted VSL400 directory and never
stores an access token in notebook cells. For approved Zenodo users, it can also
download the restricted multipart release directly into a Colab runtime using a
`ZENODO_TOKEN` supplied through Colab Secrets, with HTTP resume and MD5 checks.
